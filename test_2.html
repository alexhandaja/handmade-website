        <h2> Historical Context 
          </h2>
          <h3>
          Chinese in Indonesia: 
        
          </p>
          <p>
            1. The Chinese make up less than 5% of the population, but they control about 70% of Indonesia's wealth.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. An Islamist leader accused the President of Indonesia of favoring the ethnic Chinese. This ethnic wealth gap has played a part in the resentment that "pribumi" have for them.
          </p>
    
            <p>
              3. The hostility between the Chinese and Indonesians all began during the period where we were colonized by the Dutch. They created a class system known as the Dutch East Indies which was the origin of centuries of racial division. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Europeans: First-Class 
              </p>
              <p>
                Chinese and Indians: Second-Class 
              </p>
Chinese and Indians: Second-Class 
</p>
<p>
  Indonesians: Third-Class (exploited and controlled) (they were tortured, raped, executed)
</p>

          
    
            <p>
              This divide caused distrust in the Chinese. Economic factors played a role: most natives were poor and perceived the Chinese as occupying some of the most prosperous neighborhoods in the city.
