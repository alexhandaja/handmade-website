            When my grandparents passed away this summer, it felt like all the 'Chinese' parts of me had disappeared with them. They were both very traditional Chinese people and constantly encouraged us to be proud of our roots no matter what, and pushed us to always partake in cultural celebrations and their teachings. 

              </p>
          <p>
            -- This project was an opportunity for not only me but my community to delve into why Chinese-Indonesians still feel a sense of alienation to this day. It also pushed me to get in touch with my Chinese roots and learn about aspects of my culture that I never had the chance to.
